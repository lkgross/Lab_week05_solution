# Lab_week05_solution
This repository is for support in quizzing yourself on Lab Week 5.
This lab is for additional practice and to develop more expertise. Compare your work with mine and get some ideas from the code I wrote. I am posting this solution with Monday-lab students in mind, who will not get the in-person lab guidance on October 10, 2022 because of Columbus Day/Indigenous Peoples Day.
